# Max's Transparency Fight Club 🦔

A playful tribute to PostHog's culture, Charles Cook (VP of Ops), and my journey from GitLab (Tanuki) to PostHog (Max the Hedgehog). This is my "HogFlix moment" - a creative resume that showcases both technical skills and cultural alignment.

## 🎯 Why I Built This

This app serves as:
- **A fun technical demo** - Showcasing modern web development skills
- **A cultural love letter** - Demonstrating deep appreciation for PostHog's transparency values
- **A creative resume** - Standing out from traditional application formats
- **A Zero-to-One example** - From idea to deployment using AI-assisted development

## 📖 My Story

**GitLab → Respondo → Humanitec → PostHog**

- **GitLab** 🦝: Started as a Tanuki enthusiast, loved the culture but transparency had limits
- **Respondo** 💬: Learned the power of customer feedback and real-time communication  
- **Humanitec** 🚀: Dove deep into platform engineering and developer experience
- **PostHog** 🦔: Found my transparency tribe! Max > Tanuki. Fight me.

**See you on Superday, Max!** 🦔✨

*P.S. - If this doesn't get me an interview, at least I had fun building it and learned a ton about AI-assisted development. That's a win in my book (which, thanks to Charles, is now Zero to One).*
