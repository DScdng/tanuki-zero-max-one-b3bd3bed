# 🦔 Max's Transparency Fight Club

A playful tribute to PostHog's culture, Charles Cook (VP of Ops), and my journey from GitLab (Tanuki) to PostHog (Max the Hedgehog). This is my "HogFlix moment" - a creative resume that showcases both technical skills and cultural alignment.

## 🎯 Why I Built This

This app serves as:
- **A fun technical demo** - Showcasing modern web development skills with real backend integration
- **A cultural love letter** - Demonstrating deep appreciation for PostHog's transparency values
- **A creative resume** - Standing out from traditional application formats
- **A Zero-to-One example** - From idea to full-stack deployment using AI-assisted development

## 📖 My Story

**GitLab → Respondo → Humanitec → PostHog**

- **GitLab** 🦝: Started as a Tanuki enthusiast, loved the culture but transparency had limits
- **Respondo** 💬: Learned the power of customer feedback and real-time communication
