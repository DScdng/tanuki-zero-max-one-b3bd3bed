              When I started working on Max's Transparency Fight Club, my goal was to take my 3rd-round interview at PostHog from 0 to 1 something creative, fun, and undeniably different. I dove straight into 'vibe coding' with Lovable because it felt fast. In just hours, I had a web app running with fake A/B tests, custom surveys, and event tracking. I thought I'd nailed the '1' moment.
            </p>

            <p>
              But here's the twist; when I looked closer, I realized I wasn't really using PostHog at all. Lovable had basically copy-pasted PostHog features and built its own overengineered versions. I was still at zero, just with fancier HTML.
            </p>

            <p>
              So I stopped, stripped out the fake features, and rebuilt the app using PostHog's native power, real feature flags, real surveys, real event tracking, all managed directly in the PostHog dashboard. That's when I understood the difference between building something flashy and building something real.
            </p>

            <p>
              I like to think that's the real 0 to1 moment, not the tool I used to code, but realizing that PostHog itself was the thing I needed to showcase, not replicate.
