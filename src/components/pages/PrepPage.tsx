            Just finished my final prep for the PostHog superday tomorrow, where I am still not sure what the tasks will be. 
            I cloned the HogFlix demo and connected it to a new project in the PostHog app, and also joined the invitation 
            to a HogFlix organization sent by the PostHog team.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            I believe I'll do a demo with PostHog and the HogFlix demo, but just in case I've made a setup of the local 
            dev environment for PostHog itself which took... ermm... a few hours. My old MacBook Pro is melting down 
            and was loading the app in the browser on its own for 30 minutes haha.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            But here we are! I can follow the PostHog developing locally part of the handbook... so far! 
            Here I'll stop so I can have my MacBook spared for tomorrow's challenges.
